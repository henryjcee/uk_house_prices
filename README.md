# What is this for?

This is a notebook I initially put together as part of my own research into buying a property in the UK. I figured it 
might be helpful to others as lots of this data is available but not in an easy to analyse format, especially if you
want to do quick comparisons across time and locations. 

# Google Colab

This notebook is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O8Tdp1t90XqT-M479ORx6FrVeWpt2qwl?usp=sharing) 
if you just want to run it.

All comments/queries/suggestions/issues/PRs welcome. Would be particularly interested in hearing how the 
data presented here either confirms or contradicts your experience buying a property in the UK.
